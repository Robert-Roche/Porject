# NHL Game Predictor

The game of hockey has always been notorious for predicting the outcome as the game is fast paced and low scoring. The puck's bounces and deflection add an element of randomness to the game. This element of randomness allows for the worst team to occasionally win in an upset. With that being considered, this project goal is to see how well machine learning can do to predict the outcome of the game. The baseline we looked to beat was home team advantage which produced a winner 55.4% of the time and the favorite win percentage which many betting articles claimed it to be around 60%. The project explores NHL data from kaggle that spans over multiple season. The key stats we payed attention to were things like a teams shots per game, power play goal percentage, and even things like faceoff win percentage. Then testing out many different classifiers we achieved an accuracy of 85% for two different classifying methods. With these results the next goal for future work would be to scrape this season's data and predict the outcome of tonight's games.
